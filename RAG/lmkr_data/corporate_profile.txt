activities, and ultimately provide a more intelligent use of transport networks.
TRVERSE offers a whole host of products that are designed to perform various functions
that are needed in a holistic transport system.
A full-fledged transport system is usually a cohesive system made of many individual
component parts. In developing often times an upgrade of old systems is a gradual
process. Our products can be helpful in this process as they can be fully integrated into
existing systems without requiring a complete overhaul or a custom built system.
Such offerings include:
(a)Automated Fare Collection:
Automated fare collection systems are integrated ticketing systems that
provide faster transactions, affordable operations and more efficient
collection of payments. Our fare collection systems work with a variety of
devices for sale and validation of travel documents such as virtual and
physical tickets and tokens as well as transport cards. Our solution also
works with a variety of payment modes such as mobiles, card and cash
to automate the payment process and grant customer access to the site.

(b) Scheduling and Dispatch:
Computer-aided scheduling and dispatch system tracks the locations of
all vehicles, compares them with the planned data and provides the
dispatcher with a complete overview of operational processes.
Implementation of our solution allows you to systematize and regulate
the procedure of releasing the vehicles to the route. Keep precise records
of every driver's work and every vehicle's operation as well as to provide
quick and effective communication between the drivers and traffic
control operators.

(c) Signal Priority System
These systems reduce transit times, improve schedule adherence and
increase road network efficiency as measured by the mobility of people.
Our signal priority systems allow you to smooth out the flow of traffic by
both detecting the presence of a vehicle and predicting its arrival time at
the intersection. Our real-time, adaptive systems can incorporate
information on traffic flow, flow coordination, bus schedule adherence,
and prior bus arrival times.
