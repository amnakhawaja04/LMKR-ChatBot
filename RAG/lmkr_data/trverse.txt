Award Winning Solution
- Automated Fare Collection
Ticket To A Better Ride
Fare is a key source of income for any transport company. Our automated fare collection systems make this process of paying and receiving fares significantly simple for both the passenger and the carrier.

Automated fare collection systems are integrated ticketing systems that provide faster transactions, affordable operations, and more efficient collection of payments.
Our fare collection systems work with a variety of devices for the sale and validation of travel documents, such as virtual and physical tickets and tokens, as well as transport cards.

This solution also works with multiple payment modes, such as mobiles, cards and cash, to automate the payment process and grant customers access to the site.

Benefits of an Automated Fare Collection System

Contactless payment, Mobile wallets, Improved passenger service quality, Controlled flow of funds, Reduced fraud and theft losses, Protection to the protector

How it Works:
Our automated fare collection system works to collect payment from customers through multiple channels, including mobile wallets, ticket vending machines, and point of sale. This payment, which can be in the form of tokens or virtual, is then inserted into turnstiles or validators installed on board vehicles connected to a data center.

Our system is intuitive and allows the application of a flexible tariff policy and its management in real time for enhanced service quality.

Intelligent Transport System
Achieving Traffic Efficiency Through Innovation

In any city, mobility is a key concern; be it going to school, office, or any other purpose. Citizens use the transport system to travel within the city. Leveraging citizens with an Intelligent Transport Management System can save their time and make the city even smarter.

Intelligent Transport System (ITS) aims to achieve traffic efficiency by minimizing traffic problems. It enriches users with prior information about traffic, local convenience, real-time running information, seat availability, etc., which reduces travel time of commuters as well as enhances their safety and comfort.

Scheduling System
On Time, Always

Scheduling is a critical component of mass transit systems, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and timely service. It enables transit operators to plan resources accurately, manage vehicles and drivers, and coordinate all moving parts of the system.

Benefits of Scheduling:

Efficient fleet management

Improved passenger service quality

Cost savings through optimized resource allocation

Responsiveness to changes in external conditions

More reliable transport system

How it Works:

Timetable Generation: A complete timetable is generated, detailing all services.

Vehicle Scheduling: Vehicles are allocated based on requirements such as peak/off-peak periods.

Driver Scheduling: Drivers are scheduled considering work hours, lunch breaks, total shift time, and labor regulations.

Resource Optimization: All calculations ensure optimal deployment of vehicles and drivers.

Outcome: The result is a seamless timetable that ensures smooth service for both operators and passengers.

Dispatching System
Smooth Operations, All in Real-Time

The dispatch system ensures timely vehicle release and continuous monitoring of transit operations. It is essential for:

Maintaining schedules

Managing vehicle flow and intervals

Monitoring departures and arrivals

Recording activities across all routes

How it Works:

Real-Time Monitoring: Dispatch systems gather live data on vehicle location and status.

Route Display & Status Updates: Routes and their operational status are displayed in real-time.

Driver Communication: Supports communication with drivers onboard.

Operational Control: By integrating software and hardware components, dispatch systems implement strategies to maintain smooth operations.

Outcome: Ensures a seamless journey for passengers from the first mile to the last mile.


Signal Priority System (TSP)

Improve Your Transit Reliability

Transit Signal Priority (TSP) systems optimize traffic flow for public transport vehicles, reducing delays and improving schedule adherence.

Benefits:

Eliminates unnecessary delays

Improved fuel efficiency

Increased people throughput

Reduces congestion

Improved travel time

Enhanced traffic system reliability

How it Works:

Transit vehicles send a signal to the traffic signal controller.

The controller adjusts traffic signal timing based on:

Vehicle presence and predicted arrival time

Traffic flow and coordination

Bus schedule adherence and prior bus arrivals

Outcome: smoother traffic flow and prioritized public transport movement

Information Management System (IMS)

Better Transportation, Better Life

The IMS integrates multiple passenger communication and infotainment systems to improve service quality, operational efficiency, and passenger satisfaction.

Public Address (PA) System

Get Your Message Across

PA systems deliver voice announcements to passengers at stops and in vehicles, ensuring critical information is clear, intelligible, and audible above ambient noise.

How it Works:

Components include microphones, amplifiers, and loudspeakers.

A mixing console or powered mixer ensures uniform sound coverage and adequate levels.

Essential for security, safety, and emergency messaging.

Infotainment System

Bridge the Revenue Gap

Infotainment systems enhance the passenger experience while creating new revenue streams via advertising.

Benefits:

Additional revenue through targeted advertising

Improved passenger experience

Provides travel and local information

Entertainment for commuters

Hyper-local advertising opportunities

How it Works:

HD digital displays deliver multimedia content to passengers.

Content includes real-time travel information, weather, news, ads, social media, and security camera feeds.

Location-based targeting allows dynamic content delivery onboard.

Passenger Information System (PIS)

Get Your Message Across in Real-Time

PIS provides timely, accurate passenger information, improving satisfaction and operational efficiency.

Benefits:
