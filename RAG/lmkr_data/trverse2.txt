Client Story: Peshawar BRT

Helping Our Clients Shape an Intelligent Transport System

Overview

Peshawar, a major center of trade and commerce, has a population of 2.2 million with limited public transportation infrastructure. To address this, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government launched a cost-efficient, sustainable mass transit system to transform urban mobility.

LMKR, in collaboration with its partners, designed and deployed an intelligent transport system, launched in 2020, serving:

220K+ daily ridership (2021)

158 buses across 9 routes

60K+ mobile app downloads

50M+ total passengers

114M km distance traveled

1M+ Zu cards sold

Lahore Metro

Ensuring Optimum Services and Security of Commuters

Overview

The Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) was tasked with creating and maintaining a safe, efficient, and comfortable urban transportation system for the people of Lahore. To tackle this challenge, the Government of Pakistan partnered with LMKR to ensure that the feeder routes of the metro bus projects in Lahore operate at optimal levels. The LMKR-provided security solution aims to provide commuters with a secure and hassle-free journey.

The centrally controlled video surveillance system not only safeguards passengers but also enables quick restoration of traffic in case of emergencies or service breakdowns.

Key Stats:

180K+ Daily Ridership

200 Total Buses

27 Total Routes

28.5 KM Distance Travelled

17 Feeder Routes

Challenge

With a population exceeding 11 million, growing at 3.5% annually, Lahore is the second largest city in Pakistan. Historically, public transport in Lahore was unsafe, fragmented, underdeveloped, and inefficient. Residents preferred private vehicles, worsening traffic congestion, accidents, harassment, and road-related issues.

Many public transport vehicles operated without valid licenses, overfilled passengers, and offered little comfort or security. This led to an increase in private vehicle ownership, placing further strain on the city’s roads and deteriorating the quality of life. Lahore needed a public transport system capable of attracting commuters back to buses.

Solution

The PMA partnered with LMKR to provide, maintain, and operate an integrated solution covering security, communication networks, network monitoring, KPI monitoring, and helpdesk support for the Lahore Metrobus feeder routes.

The solution provides commuters with a secure, hassle-free journey, while monitoring bus operator performance to ensure the required operational standards are met. The system safeguards passengers, centralizes monitoring of bus operations and infrastructure, and ensures rapid traffic restoration in emergencies or service disruptions.

Multan Metro

Ensuring Optimum Services and Security of Commuters

Overview

The Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) was established for the planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of mass transit systems in major cities of Punjab. The department aims to increase access to public transit while reducing pollution and traffic congestion.

To maintain a safe and comfortable urban transport system in Multan, the Government of Pakistan partnered with LMKR to start the Metro Bus Service, providing a secure and hassle-free environment for commuters. The centrally controlled video surveillance system captures all angles in and around buses, enhancing onboard safety and enabling quick restoration of traffic in emergencies.

Key Stats:

100K+ Daily Ridership

135 Total Buses

21 Stations

18.5 KM Corridor Length

560 Cameras

14 Feeder Routes

Challenge

Multan, the fifth largest city in Punjab, has seen its population grow from 1.1 million in 1998 to over 2 million in 2021, with projections of 2.5% annual growth over the next decade. As a major cultural and economic center of Southern Punjab, Multan experiences significant commuting traffic.

Historically, public transport relied on Mazda, Toyota Hiace, Suzuki vans, and rickshaws, with no organized bus service. Minibuses offered substandard service, prompting commuters to rely on private vehicles. This led to traffic congestion, accidents, and deterioration of the road network, negatively impacting the overall quality of life.

Solution

To address this, PMA partnered with LMKR to provide, operate, and maintain an integrated solution covering security, communication networks, network monitoring, KPI monitoring, and helpdesk services for Metro Bus Multan.

The solution ensures a secure and hassle-free journey for commuters, monitors bus operator performance, centralizes operations, and enables rapid traffic restoration during emergencies or breakdowns. It safeguards passengers while ensuring smooth and efficient transit operations throughout the network.
